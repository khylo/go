/*
Write a program to sort an array of integers. The program should partition the 
array into 4 parts, each of which is sorted by a different goroutine. 
Each partition should be of approximately equal size. Then the main goroutine 
should merge the 4 sorted subarrays into one large sorted array. 

The program should prompt the user to input a series of integers. Each goroutine 
which sorts Â¼ of the array should print the subarray that it will sort. When 
sorting is complete, the main goroutine should print the entire sorted list.
